# Nimslo3D-pcb

Most parts come from an Arduino pro mini (I use the 3.3v versions, but 5v should also work fine).

## Known issues
Due to time constraints on my end right now, I will not actively maintain this project. 
- Flash trigger does not work or works inconsistently (tried with and optocoupler but doesn't seem to do the trick)
- There is no program port. I always use a holder that goes over the SMD chip but I am unable to find that part again :/
- LDR is not very stable, (it does use the sizing for the original one).
- Documentation is non-existant

If you make changes, please make a PR :)
